Advantages and Disadvantages of Recursion
When a recursive call is made, new storage locations for variables are allocated on the stack. As, each recursive call returns, the old variables and parameters are removed from the stack. Hence, recursion generally uses more memory and is generally slow.
On the other hand, a recursive solution is much simpler and takes less time to write, debug and maintain.
